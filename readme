An Index of Computer Science for Practitioners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comets arrive, bright with borrowed fire,
promising their blaze will stay.
Morning steals them anyway.

Beneath the trailing glow,
all that may be and may never be gathers.
A river bends unseen,
tracing arcs like frozen light.

Pearls gleam in your hand,
but seeds you let fall
sprout into trees,
and trees into forests.

After glitter fades,
a silent thunder
echoes from the dawn of time.
