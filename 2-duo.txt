Chapter 2: From Collection to Connection
=================================================

Elementary Set Theory
---------------------

A set is a collection of distinct objects.

Notation:
  {1, 2, 3}           - explicit set
  x IN S              - x is an element of S
  A SUBSET B          - every element of A is in B
  EMPTY SET           - the set with no elements

Operations:
  A UNION B           - elements in A or B
  A INTERSECT B       - elements in both A and B
  A MINUS B           - elements in A but not in B
  POWER SET of A      - set of all subsets of A


Cartesian Product
-----------------

The Cartesian product of sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs.

Notation:
  A CROSS B = {(a, b) | a IN A AND b IN B}


Algebraic Data Types: Products and Sums
----------------------------------------

Product type (A CROSS B):
  Combines two types into ordered pairs.
  Example: Natural number CROSS Boolean

Sum type (A + B):
  Disjoint union - element from A or B, tagged with origin.
  Example: Integer + Boolean = elements from Integer or Boolean


Relations
---------

A relation R from set A to set B is a subset of A CROSS B.

Notation:
  (a, b) IN R, or: a R b

Properties of a relation R on a set A:
  Reflexive:     FOR ALL x, x R x
  Symmetric:     FOR ALL x, y, (x R y) IMPLIES (y R x)
  Transitive:    FOR ALL x, y, z, (x R y AND y R z) IMPLIES (x R z)
  Antisymmetric: FOR ALL x, y, (x R y AND y R x) IMPLIES (x = y)


Graphs
------

Given a relation E on a set V, we can visualize it as a graph.

A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
  V - set of vertices
  E - edges on V (E SUBSET V CROSS V)
  
If (u, v) IN E, we say there is an edge from u to v.

Types:
  Directed graph:   relation E using ordered pairs (u, v)
  Undirected graph: relation E is symmetric

Terminology:
  Path:      sequence v1, v2, ..., vn where (vi, vi+1) IN E
  Cycle:     path where first and last vertex are the same
  Connected: FOR ALL u, v IN V, EXISTS path from u to v
  Tree:      connected graph with no cycles


Equivalence Relations
---------------------

An equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Equivalence class of x:
  [x] = {y | x R y}

Partition:
  An equivalence relation divides a set into disjoint equivalence classes.


Partial Orders
--------------

A partial order is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

Notation:
  (S, ≤) is a partially ordered set (poset)

Special elements:
  Minimal:  no element is smaller
  Maximal:  no element is larger
  Least:    smaller than all elements
  Greatest: larger than all elements


Functions
---------

A function is a special relation where each input maps to exactly one output.

A function f: A -> B is a subset of A CROSS B where:
  FOR ALL a IN A, EXISTS unique b IN B, (a, b) IN f

Notation:
  f(x) = y means (x, y) IN f

Properties:
  Injective (one-to-one):  different inputs map to different outputs
  Surjective (onto):       every element of B is mapped to
  Bijective:               both injective and surjective

Composition:
  (g * f)(x) = g(f(x)) - apply f, then apply g


Algebraic Data Types: Function Types
-------------------------------------

Function type (A -> B):
  Type of functions mapping from A to B.
  Example: Integer -> Boolean represents functions that take an integer
  and return a boolean.

Higher-order functions:
  Functions that take functions as arguments or return functions.
  Example: (A -> B) -> (B -> C) -> (A -> C) is function composition.
