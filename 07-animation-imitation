Transition Systems
------------------

A transition system models state evolution through discrete transitions.

Formal definition:
  (S, s0, T) where:
    S - set of states
    s0 - initial state
    T SUBSET S CROSS S - transition relation

A transition (s, s') IN T means the system can move from state s to s'.

Execution: sequence of states s0, s1, s2, ... where (si, si+1) IN T


Semiautomata
------------

A semiautomaton adds an input alphabet to a transition system.

Formal definition:
  (S, A, delta) where:
    S - set of states
    A - input alphabet
    delta: S CROSS A -> S - transition function

Reading input string a1 a2 ... an produces state sequence:
  s0, delta(s0, a1), delta(delta(s0, a1), a2), ...


Finite State Automata
----------------------

A finite state automaton recognizes languages by accepting or rejecting strings.

Formal definition:
  (Q, A, delta, q0, F) where:
    Q - finite set of states
    A - input alphabet
    delta: Q CROSS A -> Q - transition function (deterministic)
    q0 - initial state
    F SUBSET Q - set of accept states

Deterministic FSA (DFA):
  delta(q, a) gives exactly one next state

Nondeterministic FSA (NFA):
  delta: Q CROSS A -> P(Q) (power set of Q)
  delta(q, a) gives a set of possible next states

Equivalence:
  For every NFA, there exists an equivalent DFA recognizing the same language.
  Construction: subset construction (states of DFA = subsets of NFA states)


Pushdown Automata
-----------------

A pushdown automaton extends FSA with a stack for unbounded memory.

Formal definition:
  (Q, A, G, delta, q0, Z0, F) where:
    Q - finite set of states
    A - input alphabet
    G - stack alphabet
    delta: Q CROSS (A UNION {EPSILON}) CROSS G -> P(Q CROSS G*)
    q0 - initial state
    Z0 - initial stack symbol
    F - accept states

Deterministic PDA:
  At most one transition for each (q, a, Z) configuration

Nondeterministic PDA:
  Multiple possible transitions

Note: Deterministic and nondeterministic PDAs are NOT equivalent.
Nondeterministic PDAs recognize exactly the context-free languages.


Turing Machines
---------------

A Turing machine has an infinite tape for unbounded memory.

Formal definition:
  (Q, A, G, delta, q0, qaccept, qreject) where:
    Q - finite set of states
    A - input alphabet
    G - tape alphabet (A SUBSET G)
    delta: Q CROSS G -> Q CROSS G CROSS {L, R} - transition function
    q0 - initial state
    qaccept - accept state
    qreject - reject state

Operation:
  Read symbol on tape, write symbol, move head left (L) or right (R)

Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM):
  delta is a function (single transition per configuration)

Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM):
  delta: Q CROSS G -> P(Q CROSS G CROSS {L, R})
  Multiple possible transitions

Equivalence: DTM and NTM recognize the same languages.


Universal Turing Machine
-------------------------

A universal Turing machine U can simulate any Turing machine M.

Input to U:
  <M, w> (encoded string representing machine M and input w)

Operation:
  U simulates M on input w
  U accepts if M accepts w
  U rejects if M rejects w


Church-Turing Thesis
--------------------

All reasonable models of computation are equivalent in power.

Equivalences:
  Turing machines EQUIV Lambda calculus

These models compute exactly the same class of functions (computable functions).

The thesis is not a mathematical theorem but a claim about the nature of
computation, supported by evidence: every computational model proposed has
proven equivalent to Turing machines.
